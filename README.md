# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Our goal for this analysis was analyze all the rideshare data at PyBer from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization. Our goal with this analyization is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
As we went through the data, we were able to create a dataframe that clearly showed differences in many metrics based on city type.

By looking at this data frame we can see the following differences:

1. **Total Rides**
    * Clearly, the total rides were lowest in the rural areas, slightly higher for suburban, and the highest for urban.
2. **Total Drivers**
    * Similar to the total rides, the total drivers were lowest in rural areas, more drivers in suburban areas, and the most in urban areas.
3. **Total Fares**
    * The differences between total fares for city type was a big difference. Again, we see that the total fare for rural areas is about 10% of total 
4. **Average Fare per Ride**
    * Here, the average fare per ride was the highest for the rural areas, and drops in price the more urban the area or city is.
5. **Average Fare per Driver**
    * Similar to average fare per ride, urban city types have a higher average fare per driver.
6. **Total Fare by City Type**
      * Here, when we look at the graph:

    we see that the urban city types are the highest, but that they have more pronounced peaks, which could indicate events in the cities. For the suburban type, we see one main peak, which could also indicate an event.

## Summary

There are disparities in the data between the city types. We can assume that the fare is directly related to the city type and the availability of drivers - the more drivers, the lower the fare. 

Because we also have lower demand for rides in rural areas, it may not make sense to increase drivers.

Recommendations to address the disparities:

1. Provide incentives for rural drivers - this may help lower the average fare cost in rural areas.
2. Provide incentives for drivers during slower times (no events), to help encourage lower fares during non-peak times.
3. Provide city "transfer" options - an option for suburban and urban drivers to drive in rural areas during busier times. This could increase the number of drivers, and help lower the fare in rural areas.
